GSA paper (CDF_figs):

CDF plot. 
Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Chakravart, Laha, and Roy, 1967) used to decide if a sample comes from a population with a specific distribution. In this case, used to test whether channel complex dimensions (width, depth, and aspect ratio) on the structured region of the slope come from the same underlying distribution as the channel cross-sectional dimension unstructured part of the slope. 

Sinuosity Curvature plots (Fig_sinuosity_curvature);

Functions for creating plots of downstream distance against sinuosity and curvature from the output of sinusosity curvature function presented in Sylvester & Pirmez (2017). Scatter plot of curvature against sinuosity fitted with a linear model.
